# Piscine Reloaded
**_It's good to be back_**

This project is the first project of our curriculum in Hive Helsinki, a "best of" compilation of all the exercises we did during our month-long coding bootcamp called the _Piscine_. The exercises involved are functions or programs written in C, or related to some basic-level use of shell.

You can find more info and detailed instructions from the subject .pdf.
